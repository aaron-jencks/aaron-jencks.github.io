I'm a Computer Science graduate student at The Ohio State University with research interests spanning natural language processing, computational theory, and systems optimization. My work explores how phonetic representations can improve AI models for low-resource languages, including custom GPT training on International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) data.

I have strong experience with machine learning, high-performance computing (HPC), and systems programming, including distributed model training on Slurm clusters, embedded programming on RISC-V architectures, and network system design. I focus on building efficient, scalable solutions by combining low-level control with high-level algorithmic reasoning.

Outside of research and engineering, I enjoy running, restoring retro computers, and experimenting with vintage hardware and software ecosystems. I'm also passionate about studying language evolution and optimizing computational workflows from the operating system up to the application layer.
